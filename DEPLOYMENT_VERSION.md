# Deployment Version

**Deployment Timestamp**: 2025-06-30 04:23:00
**Git Commit**: Latest with diagnostic endpoint and fixed parse API
**Expected Features**:

- ✅ Diagnostic endpoint at `/api/diagnostic`
- ✅ Parse API with `{success: true, ...}` format
- ✅ Supabase authentication
- ✅ HuggingFace parser with fallbacks

**Test this deployment at**:

- Diagnostic: `GET /api/diagnostic`
- Parse: `POST /api/parse` (with auth)

If this file exists in production, the latest code is deployed.
If diagnostic returns 501, there's a deployment/caching issue.
